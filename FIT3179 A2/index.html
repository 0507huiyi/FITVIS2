                <p> More than 80% of people living in urban areas that monitor air pollution are exposed to air quality levels that exceed the World Health Organization (WHO) limits. While all regions of the world are affected, populations in low-income cities are the most impacted. 
                    As urban air quality declines, the risk of stroke, lung cancer, and chronic and acute respiratory diseases, including asthma, increases for the people who live in them. 
                    <br> <br> The WHO air quality database compiles data on ground measurements of annual mean concentrations of particulate matter of a diameter equal or smaller than 2.5 Î¼m (PM2.5) which aim at representing an average for the Urban or Rural area as a whole, rather than for individual stations. Both groups of pollutants originate mainly from human activities related to fossil fuel combustion. The database is updated regularly every 2-3 years since 2011 and now covering 3000 cities in 103 countries.
                    <br> <br> The world's average PM10 levels by region range from 26 to 208 ug/m3, with a world's average of 71 ug/m3.
